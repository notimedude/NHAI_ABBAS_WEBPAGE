(If additional packages are required, they can be added into a requirements.txt file.)

2. Run the Backend Server
Start the Flask app:

python app.py


By default, it runs on:
 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

3. Open the Dashboards

Admin Dashboard (Monitoring):
Open index.html in a browser or via Flask route.
Shows:
 Real-time toilet sensor status (occupancy, odor, leaks, consumables)
 SLA compliance (cleanliness, consumables, response time)
 AI predictions for maintenance
 User feedback list

User Feedback Form:
Open feedback.html in a browser or via Flask route.
Allows public users to:
 Give rating (1â€“5 stars)
 Add comments/complaints
 Upload media (photo/video/voice note)
 Provide contact for follow-up

Submitted feedback automatically updates into the backend â†’ visible in the dashboard.

 Operational Model

IoT Sensors â†’ Backend:
Toilets have PIR, odor, soap, leak, and door sensors feeding into the backend via simulated or real devices.

Backend (Flask):

Exposes APIs:

/api/all_toilets â†’ Live status for dashboard

/api/submit_feedback â†’ Collects user feedback

Stores data (currently in-memory, can be extended to DB).

Frontend (HTML Dashboards):

index.html â†’ Aggregates all toilet blocks into an accordion-style dashboard.

feedback.html â†’ Simple form with rating, text, and media uploads.

 Key Features

24x7 monitoring of highway toilets.

SLA-linked AI decision-making (cleanliness, response time, consumables).

Real-time feedback collection from users.

Emergency button alerts with banner highlights.

Visual KPIs with PASS/FAIL indicators.


HOW TO USE:

Run backend (app.py).

Open index.html â†’ Explore dashboards, SLA, AI predictions, user ratings.

Open feedback.html â†’ Submit a test feedback â†’ Confirm it appears in dashboard.

Check emergency simulation (toggle from JSON or code).
